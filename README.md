# Insurance Company Benchmark (COIL 2000)

This studies patterns and insights from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/125/insurance+company+benchmark+coil+2000), and the main objective is to study whether a client predict will be interested in buying a caravan insurance policy and give an explanation why?.

## :Data Preprocessing
- Tere are no Missing Values: all data fields are filled.
- Standardizing Numerical Features: data features were standardized to bring them to a similar scale.
    
## :Model Training
Several regression models were trained and evaluated for their performance in predicting insurance premiums:
- K-means clustering
- Random Forest Regression

## :Model Evaluation
The performance of each model was evaluated using the following metrics:
 - Baseline, Training and Test accuracy
   
## Discussion
Among the models evaluated, Logistic regression and Random Forest Regression (rfr), rfr demonstrated the best performance in terms of Training and Test accuracy. 

## Conclusion
In this project, we try to predict if the first stage of a given Falcon 9 launch will land in order to determine the cost of a launch. Each feature of a Falcon 9 launch, such as its payload mass or orbit type, may affect the mission outcome in a certain way. 

Several machine learning algorithms are employed to learn the patterns of past Falcon 9 launch data to produce predictive models that can be used to predict the outcome of a Falcon 9 launch. The predictive model produced by decision tree algorithm performed the best among the 4 machine learning algorithms employed.
